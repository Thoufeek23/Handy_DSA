# Handy DSA

Handy DSA is a repository designed to provide clean, basic implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, learning new concepts, or building foundational projects, this repository offers simple and reusable templates to help you get started. With implementations in various programming languages, it includes core data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees, alongside common algorithms like Sorting, Searching, and Graph Algorithms. You can easily build upon these implementations and extend them for more complex solutions. This collection serves as a practical tool to enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
